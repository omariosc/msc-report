\section{Experimentation}

\subsection{In-House Dataset}

% describe the flow of participants throughout the study

% number of participants

% outcome overall: Clear differences in some images (see differences in Test1 and Test2 scenes, and cut off images in Test2. Overheating in camera causing some image defects. edges more distinct, exact SOTA for opposite (YOLO in IRL, SIMO for ART)	 

% summary of follow-up

% overall characteristics of data source and setting

% we further used the best performin model to generate annotations for the rest of the dataset

\subsubsection{Data Annotations}

% overall data annotated

% issues faced

\subsection{Model Configurations}

We have specifically designed the models with helper functions throughout the repository, freely available for assistance in future development.

\subsubsection{Anchor-based Model}

\subsubsection{Anchor-free Model}

\subsection{Training Setup}

\subsection{Model Evaluation}

% IoU, mAP50, mAP50-95, MSE

\subsection{Results}

% discuss differences between SIMO and YOLO models

\subsubsection{Surgical Tool Detection}

% IMAGE: bounding box tool and tooltips

% DIAGRAMS

\subsubsection{Surgical Tool Tracking}

% IMAGE: show tracking of tool (bounding boxes over time)

% DIAGRAMS

\subsubsection{Performance of the Model}

% YOLO10 architectures
% tested with all data - overfit too easily

% SIMO - initial issues, like segmentation, changed to detection with confidence values, added FCN

% main discoveries
