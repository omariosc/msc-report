\section{Experimentation}

% The best-produced model, the anchor-free YOLOv8-X model, achieved a mAP50 of 99.5\% and a mAP50-95 of 85.6\% on the test set with an inference time of 21.7ms, approximately 46 frames per second (FPS), demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time surgical tool detection. The proposed tracking algorithm has an accuracy of 100\% over the detected tools and too.tipsl These results highlight the potential of the models for accurate tool localization, even in resource-constrained environments.

Inspired by the CholecTrack20 schematic diagram \cite{nwoye_cholectrack20_2023}, we present an intuitive way to understand the dataset.

The average number of procedures performed was 120, with a range of 0 to over a 1000, with 22 estimated to be performed on average in the last 12 months, ranging from 0 to 100. All 24 participants agreed to share their results entirely. If we categorise the surgeons skill based on number of procedures, were low is <20, medium is between 20 and 100 and high is >100, then we have 9 low, 9 medium and 6 high skilled surgeons. Results from the Edinburgh Handedness survey \cite{oldfield_assessment_1971} showed almost all surgeons were right-handed, with one left-handed (participant 12) and one who alternated hands (participant 3).
